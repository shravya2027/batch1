Functions in Javascript:
*Functions are first citizens in Javasacript.
*Functions are objects in Javascript.

->Types of functions in Javascript:
1.Function declaration statement/Pure function/Named function
2.Function Expression
3.Higher Order function,call back function
4.Arrow function
5.Nested function
6.IIFE(Immediate Invoking function Expression)

->Function declaration Statement:
*It is a set of instructions or block of code used to perform specific task.
Syntax:
        keyword  identifier  identifier
           |       |          |
        function fun-name(parameters,.....)
        {
        }---local-scope
        fun-name(arguments,....)
                     |
                 data/values(data-type)
*return-keyword:It will stop the execution of the function and control will be given to caller(programmer-the one who cause the function)
*Hoisting is possible(we can call the function before function declaration)
*Main purpose for using function in JavaScript is code reusability(write once call it multiple times).
->Create a function it should perform arithmetic operation for two numbers in which input shoulb be taken from the enduser.
->Typecasting:Converting of one type of datatype into another type
->Implicit typecasting:Converting of one type of datatype into another type by javascript engine.
->Explicit typecasting:Converting of one type of datatype into another type by programmer.
2.Write a function to find largest of three numbers and the input will be given from the enduser.
->Function Expression:
*Assigning function as a value to one variable is called function Expression. 
*It is used to perform specific task
->Anonomous Function:A function having no name.
*Difference between function declaration and function expression is hoisting.
3.Create a function expression to perform arithmetic operation for three numbers and find the largest of three numbers and find the largest of three numbers and the input should be taken from the end user.
->Funtion Programming:
Higher order function and callback function:
*It is used to perform generic task(multiple task).
*It can be created using function declaration statement or function expression or arrow function.
->Higher order function:
*A function which accepts another function as an argument.
->Callback function:
*A function which passed as an argument to higher order function
*With the help of higher order function and callback function we can perform multiple tasks.
->Arrow function:
*It was introduced in ES-6 version 2015(ECMA(European computer manufacture association)-SCRIPT)/LIVE-SCRIPT/MOCHA
*It is used to reduce number of lines in a code
* There are two types of return:
1.Implicit return arrow function
2.Explicit return arrow function

->Implicit return arrow function:
*no need of using return keyword
Syntax:
let a = () => console.log("hello");
console.log(a);
a()
           |
       fat arrow

->Explicit return arrow function:
*return keyword is mandatory

let b = () => { return "hello" }
console.log(b);
console.log(b());
